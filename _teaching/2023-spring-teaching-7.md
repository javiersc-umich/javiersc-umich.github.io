EECS351 is a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) course where I lead a weekly discussion reinforcing course material through further mathematical analysis and examples. Moreover, I moderated the Canvas/Piazza forum section to answer student questions related to homework and general course questions. This is besides the usual GSI expectations of dealing with homework assignments and tests.
