EECS551 is a linear algebra based course called matrix methods where I lead a weekly discussion that covers coding algorithms in Julia for classification tasks using linear algebra techniques. Moreover, we go through example questions to reinforce course material and exam preparation. Moreover, I moderated the Canvas/Piazza forum section to answer student questions related to homework and general course questions. This is besides the usual GSI expectations of dealing with homework assignments, tests, and office hours.
