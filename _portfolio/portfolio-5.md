# FCOS: A Simple One-Stage and Anchor-Free Object Detector

In this exercise you will implement a single-stage object detector based on [FCOS: Fully-Convolutional One-Stage Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01355) and train it to detect a set of object classes.
Our detector design is highly similar to FCOS itself, except we train a smaller model with slightly different hyperparameters to manage with limited resources on Colab.

This problem set will use a small version of the popular image detection dataset Pascal VOC.

We will also evaluate the detection accuracy using the mean Average Precision ([mAP](https://github.com/Cartucho/mAP)).

## Load dataset and visualize

To train our detector, we need to convert individual images (JPEG) and annotations (XML files) into batches of tensors. We perform this by wrapping our datasets with a PyTorch [DataLoader](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) object.
We have implemented it in `ps7_helpers.py` - you are not required to understand its implementation, however you should understand the format of its output.


```python
train_dataset = VOC2007Detection(
    "/content", "train", image_size=IMAGE_SHAPE[0],
    download=True  # True (for the first time and every subsequent reconnect of runtime)
)
val_dataset = VOC2007Detection("/content", "val", image_size=IMAGE_SHAPE[0])

print("Dataset sizes: train ({}), val ({})".format(len(train_dataset),len(val_dataset)))

    Dataset sizes: train (2501), val (2510)



```python
train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
    train_dataset, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, pin_memory=True, num_workers=NUM_WORKERS
)

# Use batch_size = 1 during inference - during inference we do not center crop
# the image to detect all objects, hence they may be of different size. It is
# easier and less redundant to use batch_size=1 rather than zero-padding images.
val_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
    val_dataset, batch_size=1, pin_memory=True, num_workers=NUM_WORKERS
)
```

The `DataLoader` objects return batches of data.

The first output from the `DataLoader` is a Tensor `image` of shape `(B, 3, IMAGE_SHAPE[0], IMAGE_SHAPE[1])`. This is a batch of `B` images, similar to what we have seen in classification datasets.

The second output from the `DataLoader` is a Tensor `gt_boxes` of shape `(B, N, 5)` giving information about all objects in all images of the batch. `gt_boxes[i, j] = (x1, y1, x2, y2, C)` gives information about the `j`th object in `image[i]`. The position of the top-left corner of the box is `(x1, y1)` and the position of the bottom-right corner of the box is `(x2, x2)`. These coordinates are real-valued in `[0, 224]`. `C` is an integer giving the category label for this bounding box. This `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` format for bounding boxes is commonly referred as XYXY format.

Each image can have different numbers of objects. If `image[i]` has $N_i$ objects, then $N = \max_i(N_i)$ is the maximum number of objects per image among all objects in the batch; this value can vary from batch to batch. For the images that have fewer than $N$ annotated objects, only the first $N_i$ rows of `gt_boxes[i]` contain annotations; the remaining rows are padded with -1.


```python
train_loader_iter = iter(train_loader)
image_paths, images, gt_boxes = train_loader_iter.next()

print("image paths           : {}".format(image_paths))
print("image batch has shape : {}".format(images.shape))
print("gt_boxes has shape    : {}".format(gt_boxes.shape))

print("Five boxes per image  :")
print(gt_boxes[:, 0, :])
```

## Visualize PASCAL VOC 2007

Before starting to build your model, it is highly recommended that you visualize your training data and observe some examples. This can help uncover any bugs in dataloading and sometimes even give you strong intuitions to include a modeling component!

We also use a function to visualize our detections, implemented in `ps7_helpers`. You are not required to understand it but we encourage you to read it! Here we sample some images from the PASCAL VOC 2007 training set, and visualize the ground-truth object boxes and category labels:


```python
# Define an "inverse" transform for the image that un-normalizes by ImageNet
# color and mean. Without this, the images will NOT be visually understandable.
# You can check how it will look otherwise by just commenting line which applies
# the inverser norm.

inverse_norm = transforms.Compose(
    [
        transforms.Normalize(mean=[0., 0., 0.], std=[1 / 0.229, 1 / 0.224, 1 / 0.225]),
        transforms.Normalize(mean=[-0.485, -0.456, -0.406], std=[1., 1., 1.]),
    ]
)

for idx, (_, image, gt_boxes) in enumerate(train_dataset):
    # Stop after visualizing three images.
    if idx > 2:
        break

    # Un-normalize image to bring in [0, 1] RGB range.
    image = inverse_norm(image)

    # Remove padded boxes from visualization.
    is_valid = gt_boxes[:, 4] >= 0
    detection_visualizer(image, val_dataset.idx_to_class, gt_boxes[is_valid])
```

## 7.1 (b) Implementing Backbone and Feature Pyramid Network

First, we start building the backbone and FPN of our detector (blue and green parts above). It is the core component that takes in an image and outputs its features of different scales. It can be any type of convolutional network that progressively downsamples the image.

Here, we use a small [RegNetX-400MF](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html#torchvision.models.regnet_x_400mf) as the backbone so we can train in reasonable time on Colab. We have already implemented the minimal logic to initialize this backbone from pre-trained ImageNet weights and extract intermediate features `(c3, c4, c5)` as shown in the figure above.
These features `(c3, c4, c5)` have height and width that is ${1/8}^{th}$, ${1/16}^{th}$, and ${1/32}^{th}$ of the input image respectively.
These values `(8, 16, 32)` are called the "stride" of these features.
In other words, it means that moving one location on the FPN level is equivalent to moving `stride` pixels in the input image.

You need to implement extra modules to attach the FPN to this backbone. For more details, see Figure 3 in [FPN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03144).
FPN will convert these `(c3, c4, c5)` multi-scale features to `(p3, p4, p5)`. These notations "p3", "p4", "p5" are called _FPN levels_.

Before you write any code, let's initialize the backbone in the next cell. You should see the shape of `(c3, c4, c5)` features for an input image:

Follow the instructions below to implement additional FPN layers for transforming `(c3, c4, c5)` to `(p3, p4, p5)`.
For training a small enough model on Google Colab, we leave out `(p6, p7)` as shown in the Figure.
Output features from these FPN levels are expected to have same height and width as backbone features, but now they should have the same number of channels.


```python
class DetectorBackboneWithFPN(nn.Module):
    r"""
    Detection backbone network: A tiny RegNet model coupled with a Feature
    Pyramid Network (FPN). This model takes in batches of input images with
    shape `(B, 3, H, W)` and gives features from three different FPN levels
    with shapes and total strides upto that level:

        - level p3: (out_channels, H /  8, W /  8)      stride =  8
        - level p4: (out_channels, H / 16, W / 16)      stride = 16
        - level p5: (out_channels, H / 32, W / 32)      stride = 32

    NOTE: We could use any convolutional network architecture that progressively
    downsamples the input image and couple it with FPN. We use a small enough
    backbone that can work with Colab GPU and get decent enough performance.

## 7.1 (c) Implementing FCOS prediction network (head)

By this point, you have implemented the backbone and FPN.  

Now we implement the "head" prediction layers (**orange** blocks in the Figure above). This head has shared weights across all FPN levels, and its purpose is to predict an object class, bounding box, and centerness at every location.

Look closely at the right block in the Figure which shows the inner components of head. It comprises 4-convolution layers that produce `(H, W, 256)` features (different H, W for different FPN levels) and then use one convolutional layer each to make final predictions.

You will now add these modules in `FCOSPredictionNetwork` - follow instructions in its documentation.
Below we show how to initialize and use this module.

In the expected output the classification logits have `NUM_CLASSES` channels, box regression deltas have 4 output channels, and centerness has 1 output channels.
The height and width of all outputs is flattened to one dimension, resulting in `(B, H * W, C)` format - this format is more convenient for computing loss, as you will see later.

## Train the FCOS

You have now finished implementing FCOS and it is ready to train!
Did you notice that all the trainable layers you implemented so far â€” in FPN and in prediction layers â€” are convolutional layers?
Due to this design, FCOS gets _fully-convolutional_ in its name!
It performs object detection with _only_ convolution layers, and no special anchors, proposals etc.
The next few steps focus on preparing the training pipeline for FCOS.

Recall that image classification models are trained with `(image, label)` pairs,
where `label` is an integer (more concretely a one-hot vector) that is associated with the _entire_ image.
You cannot train an object detector in this fashion because of two reasons:

1. Each image has a variable number of bounding boxes (and their class labels).
2. Any class label is not associated with an entire image, but rather only a small region enclosed by the bounding box.

Since the object detector classifies every location in feature map along with a bounding box and centerness, we need to supervise every prediction with _one and only one_ GT target. In next few cells, you will work through this assignment procedure between predictions and GT boxes.

### 7.1 (d) Assigning a GT target to every model prediction
FCOS heads make three predictions at every location: object class, bounding box, and centerness. We need to assign a GT target for each of them during training. All three predictions correspond to a single location on an FPN level `(p3, p4, p5)`, so instead we can view this problem as assigning GT boxes (and their class labels) to every FPN feature map location.

GT boxes are available (from the dataloader) as 5D vectors `(x1, y1, x2, y2, C)` where `(x1, y1)` is the top-left co-ordinate and `(x2, y2)` is the bottom-right co-ordinate of the bounding box, and C is its object class label. These co-ordinates are absolute and real-valued in image dimensions. To begin with the assignment, we will represent every location on an FPN level with (xc, yc) absolute and real-valued co-ordinates of a point on the image, that are centers of the receptive fields of those features.

For example, given features from FPN level having shape `(batch_size, channels, H / stride, W / stride)` and the location `feature[:, :, i, j]` will map to the image pixel `(stride * (i + 0.5), stride * (j + 0.5)) - 0.5` indicates the shift from top-left corner to the center of "stride box".

Implement the `get_fpn_location_coords` to get (xc, yc) location co-ordinates of all FPN features. Follow its documentation and see its usage example in the following cell:


```python
def get_fpn_location_coords(
    shape_per_fpn_level: Dict[str, Tuple],
    strides_per_fpn_level: Dict[str, int],
    dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32,
    device: str = "cpu",
) -> Dict[str, torch.Tensor]:
    """
    Map every location in FPN feature map to a point on the image. This point
    represents the center of the receptive field of this location. We need to
    do this for having a uniform co-ordinate representation of all the locations
    across FPN levels, and GT boxes.

    Args:
        shape_per_fpn_level: Shape of the FPN feature level, dictionary of keys
            {"p3", "p4", "p5"} and feature shapes `(B, C, H, W)` as values.

            integer value giving the stride of corresponding FPN level.

    Returns:
        Dict[str, torch.Tensor]

### 7.1 (e) Matching feature map locations with GT boxes

Now we match these locations with GT boxes for supervising our network. FCOS matches some `N` locations at any given FPN level with `M` GT boxes applying two rules:

> Location $N_i$ is matched with box $M_i$ if it lies inside the box. If any location lies inside two boxes, then it is matched with the smaller box. If a location does not lie inside any box, it is assigned "background".

> _Multi-scale matching_ for different FPN levels â€” for a particular FPN level, FCOS only considers a subset of boxes based on their size. Intuitively, larger boxes are assigned to `p5` and smaller boxes are assigned to `p3`.

As a result of this matching, each location wil receive a bounding box and a class label (that is 5D vector `(x1, y1, x2, y2, C)`) out of `M` GT boxes, or a background `(-1, -1, -1, -1, -1)`.

We have implemented this matching procedure for you, because we thought it is non-trivial for the limited time and difficulty level of this assignment.
However, you are required to understand its input/output format and how to use it, shown in the following cell.
We recommend you to read its implementation in `ps7_helpers.py` with name `fcos_match_locations_to_gt`. While not required for this assignment, you may refer to [Section 3.2 in FCOS paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01355).


```python
from ps7_helpers import fcos_match_locations_to_gt
```


```python
# Get an image and its GT boxes from train dataset.
#try with different images using index 1,2,3...
_, image, gt_boxes = train_dataset[0]

# Dictionary with keys {"p3", "p4", "p5"} and values as `(N, 5)` tensors
# giving matched GT boxes.
matched_boxes_per_fpn_level = fcos_match_locations_to_gt(
    locations_per_fpn_level, backbone.fpn_strides, gt_boxes
)

# Visualize one selected location (yellow point) and its matched GT box (red).
# Get indices of matched locations (whose class ID is not -1) from P3 level.
FPN_LEVEL = "p4"
# NOTE: Run this cell multiple times with FPN_LEVEL = p4,p5 to see different matched points.
# For car image, p3/5 will not work because the one and only box was already assigned
# to p4 due to its compatible size to p4 stride. Similarly for some other images

fg_idxs_p3 = (matched_boxes_per_fpn_level[FPN_LEVEL][:, 4] != -1).nonzero()

_idx = random.choice(fg_idxs_p3)

detection_visualizer(
    inverse_norm(image),
    val_dataset.idx_to_class,
    bbox=matched_boxes_per_fpn_level[FPN_LEVEL][_idx],
    points=locations_per_fpn_level[FPN_LEVEL][_idx]
)
```

In the above illustration, we can see one random location on `p3` level (**yellow dot**), and its matched GT box (**red**).
With these GT targets assigned, the FCOS preiction heads are task to predict this class label (**person**) at the given location, regress the distances between this location to all box edges `(left, top, right, bottom)`, and regress a real-valued centerness at this location.

From now on, it would help to think about FCOS behavior for a _single_ location, assuming that it has a matched GT box (or background). We shall now discuss and implement the output format of prediction layers and loss functions during training.

### 7.1 (f) GT Targets for box regression
The box regression head is tasked with predicting **FOUR** values which are the distances from feature locations (yellow dots) to box edges (red box) as we discussed above (left, top, right, bottom) or simply as we could call it â€” LTRB.

Recall that all locations and GT boxes so far are represented in absolute image co-ordinates â€” they range from (0, 224) for our input image, and can be even larger for abritrarily large input images.

We cannot use this absolute co-ordinate format with our network because regressing to such large real-valued numbers will cause the gradients to explode. Hence, FCOS normalizes LTRB targets by the stride of FPN levels. Hence in the above example, consider FPN level P3 (stride = 8), the location to be (xc, yc) (yellow point) and matched GT box have co-ordinates `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`. Then the LTRB regression targets used to supervise the network are:



```
l = (xc - x1) / stride              t = (yc - y1) / stride
r = (x2 - xc) / stride              b = (y2 - yc) / stride
```


These are commonly referred as "deltas" of box regression. Since the model is supervised to predict these during training time, one must apply an inverse transformation to these during inference to convert network outputs to predicted boxes in absolute image co-ordinates.

Next, you will implement this transformation logic and its inverse in two separate functions:

`fcos_get_deltas_from_locations` : Accepts locations (centers) and GT boxes, and returns deltas. Required for training supervision.

`fcos_apply_deltas_to_locations`: Accepts predicted deltas and locations, and returns predicted boxes. Required during inference.
Run the following cell to check your implementation.


```python
def fcos_get_deltas_from_locations(
    locations: torch.Tensor, gt_boxes: torch.Tensor, stride: int
) -> torch.Tensor:
    """
    Compute distances from feature locations to GT box edges. These distances
    are called "deltas" - `(left, top, right, bottom)` or simply `LTRB`. The
    feature locations and GT boxes are given in absolute image co-ordinates.

    These deltas are used as targets for training FCOS to perform box regression
    and centerness regression. They must be "normalized" by the stride of FPN
    feature map (from which feature locations were computed, see the function
    `get_fpn_location_coords`). If GT boxes are "background", then deltas must
    be `(-1, -1, -1, -1)`.

    NOTE: This transformation function should not require GT class label. Your
    implementation must work for GT boxes being `(N, 4)` or `(N, 5)` tensors -
    without or with class labels respectively. You may assume that all the
    background boxes will be `(-1, -1, -1, -1)` or `(-1, -1, -1, -1, -1)`.

### 7.1 (g) GT targets for centerness regression

Given the GT deltas for a location `(left, top, right, bottom)` as computed above, FCOS defines centerness as:

$$centerness = \sqrt{\frac{\min(left, right) \cdot \min(top, bottom)}{\max(left, right) \cdot \max(top, bottom)}}$$

This value is maximum (1) when `left = right` and `top = bottom`, implying the center of GT box.
At the edge of a box, one of these values will be zero, which gives zero centerness at edges.
Centerness regression head uses these values as targets.

We have implemented this function for you as centerness is not a focus of this problem set. Run the cell below to import the function from `ps7_helpers.py`. If you want, you can open the file and get an understanding of how it works.


```python
from ps7_helpers import fcos_make_centerness_targets
```

### 7.1 (h) Loss Functions

At this point, every model prediction is assigned a GT target during training.
We will proceed to compute losses for training the model.

FCOS has three prediction layers, that use the following use functions:

1. **Object classification:** FCOS uses [Sigmoid Focal Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002), an extension of cross-entropy loss that deals with class-imbalance. FCOS faces a class imbalance issue because a majority of locations would be assigned "background". If not handled properly, the model will simply learn to predict "background" for every location. We will use thee torch implementation of this loss directly using `torchvision.ops.sigmoid_focal_loss`. You can read more about it in the [torch documentation](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/generated/torchvision.ops.sigmoid_focal_loss.html)

2. **Box regression:** The FCOS paper uses [Generalized Intersection-over-Union](https://giou.stanford.edu/) loss to minimize the difference between predicted and GT `LTRB` deltas. You are not required to understand GIoU for this assignment. We will use the Torch implementation of this loss directly using `torchvision.ops.generalized_box_iou_loss`. It is used very similarly to the other Torch losses we have used so far. You can read more about it in the [Torch documentation](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/generated/torchvision.ops.generalized_box_iou_loss.html)

3. **Centerness regression:** Centerness predictions and GT targets are real-valued numbers in `[0, 1]`, so FCOS uses binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss to optimize it. One may use an L1 loss, but BCE empirically works slightly better.

**Total loss:** We get three loss components _per location_. Out of these, (2) and (3) are set to zero for _background locations_ because their GT boxes (and hence centerness) are not defined. Total loss is the sum of all losses per location, averaged by the number of _foreground locations_ (that matched with any GT box). The number of foreground locations are highly variable per image, depending on density of objects in it. Hence for training stability, the loss is instead average by an _exponential moving average of foreground locations_ (think like the running mean/var of BN, in past assignment).

You have implemented some basic forms of these losses in past assignment.
So now you are allowed to directly use builtin functions from PyTorch and Torchvision.
We highly encourage you to check out their implementation and understand them closely.

The following two cells demonstrate their use with dummy inputs and targets.
Execute them and read them carefully so you understand how to call these functions â€” immediately after, you will use them with actual predictions of FCOS, and assigned GT targets (that you implemented so far).


```python
# Sanity check: dummy model predictions for TWO locations, and
# NUM_CLASSES = 5 (typically there are thousands of locations
# across all FPN levels).
# shape: (batch_size, num_locations, num_classes)
dummy_pred_cls_logits = torch.randn(1, 2, 5)

# Corresponding one-hot vectors of GT class labels (2, -1), one
# foreground and one background.
# shape: (batch_size, num_locations, num_classes)
dummy_gt_classes = torch.Tensor([[[0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]])

# This loss expects logits, not probabilities (DO NOT apply sigmoid!)
cls_loss = sigmoid_focal_loss(
    inputs=dummy_pred_cls_logits, targets=dummy_gt_classes
)
#this value is completely random
print("Classification loss (dummy inputs/targets):")
print(cls_loss)

#this value is completely random
print(f"Total classification loss (un-normalized): {cls_loss.sum()}")

#the purpose of this sanity check is to give you an idea of how to use the different losses
```

dummy_gt_boxes = torch.Tensor(

    Centerness loss (BCE): tensor([0.7066, -0.0000])


### 7.1 (i) Object detection module

We will now combine everything into the `FCOS` class.
Implement the `__init__` and `forward` functions of this module â€” you have already done most of the heavy lifting, you simply need to call the functions in a correct way!
Use the previous two cells as a reference to implement loss calculation in `forward()`.

You can come back and implement the `inference` function later after you have successfully trained the model.

## 7.1 (j) Overfit small data

We have implemented the `train_detector` function which runs the training loop for this FCOS detector. You can read its implementation in `ps7_helpers.py`.

To make sure that everything is working as expected, we can try to overfit the detector to a small subset of data.

**NOTE:** The training loss may start low and end up higher at the end of 500 iterations, that is fine. The main training loop later will work better.


```python
reset_seed()

detector = FCOS(
    num_classes=NUM_CLASSES,
    fpn_channels=64,
    stem_channels=[64,64],
)
detector = detector.to(DEVICE)

    detector,
    train_loader,
    learning_rate=5e-3,
    max_iters=500,
    log_period=20,

)

## 7.1 (j) Train a net

Now that we are confident that the training code is working properly, let's train the network on more data and for longer. We will train for 9000 iterations; this should take about 35-40 minutes on a Tesla T4 GPU. For initial debugging, you may want to train for lesser durations (say 1000 iterations). The loss should start at around 1.3, increase for some time and settle at around 0.5-0.8.

Note that real object detection systems typically train for 12-24 hours, distribute training over multiple GPUs, and use much faster GPUs. As such our result will be far from the state of the art, but it should give some reasonable results!

**NOTE:** Pay close attention to the training for initial 1000 iterations, ometimes you might see nan values in the training loss. We have not been able to pinpoint a single cause for this. The best solution we have found for this is to just interrupt the cell execution and run it again. Take note that this may also happen due to coding errors in your case. If the overfit training also shows nan then the problem is most likely in your code.

#check which GPU you have

Save your trained detector weights


```python
torch.save(detector.state_dict(), "fcos_detector.pt")
```

## 7.1 (k) Inference

Now, we will use the trained model to perform inference on the val dataset. We have implemented a helper function for you that makes use of the `inference` function you implemented in `FCOS`. Just run the cell below to get the results.

Visualize the output from the trained model on a few eval images by running the code below, the bounding boxes should be somewhat accurate. They would get even better by using a bigger model and training it for longer.


```python
from ps7_helpers import inference_with_detector, class_spec_nms

weights_path = "fcos_detector.pt"

# Re-initialize so this cell is independent from prior cells.
detector = FCOS(
    num_classes=NUM_CLASSES, fpn_channels=128, stem_channels=[128, 128]
)
detector.to(device=DEVICE)
detector.load_state_dict(torch.load(weights_path, map_location="cpu"))

# Prepare a small val daataset for inference:
small_dataset = torch.utils.data.Subset(
    val_dataset,
    torch.linspace(0, len(val_dataset) - 1, steps=10).long()
)
small_val_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
    small_dataset, batch_size=1, pin_memory=True, num_workers=NUM_WORKERS
)

image = None
inference_with_detector(
    detector,
    small_val_loader,
    val_dataset.idx_to_class,
    score_thresh=0.5,
    nms_thresh=0.5,
    device=DEVICE,
    dtype=torch.float32,
)
```

## 7.1 (l) Evaluation
**Compute mean Average Precision (mAP)**.
For an introduction on mAP see *lecture 11* slides.
Run the following to evaluate your detector on the PASCAL VOC validation set. Evaluation should take a few minutes, and with default hyperparameters declared above, you should see at least 40% mAP.

The state of the art on this dataset is >80% mAP! To achieve these results we would need to use a much bigger network, and train with more data and for much longer, but that is beyond the scope of this assigment. **Optional:** For better mAP, you may use more conv layers in head stem, train for 25K+ iterations, and use ResNet-50/RegNet-4GF models in backbone.
But make sure you revert the code back for grading purposes.


```python
# for mAP evaluation
!rm -rf mAP
!git clone https://github.com/Cartucho/mAP.git
!rm -rf mAP/input/*
```
