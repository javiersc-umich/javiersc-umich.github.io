Hi! I am a third year PhD Candidate in the Signal and Image Processing & Machine Learning (SIPML) track of the [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/) department at the University of Michigan. I am co-advised by [Laura Balzano](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~girasole/) and [Jeffrey Fessler](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/). I am fortunate to be partially supported by the Rackham Merit Fellowship.

My research focuses on improving machine learning algorithms under heteroscedastic (noisy) data conditions and optimization algorithms for Dynamic MRI applications.
