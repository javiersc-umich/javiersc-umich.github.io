Hi! My name is Javier (pronounced like ha-bee-air). I am a third year PhD Candidate in the Signal and Image Processing & Machine Learning (SIPML) track of the [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/) department at the University of Michigan. I am co-advised by [Laura Balzano](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~girasole/) and [Jeffrey Fessler](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/). I am fortunate to be partially supported by the Rackham Merit Fellowship. My research interests are topics such as signal/image processing, machine learning, optimization, and applied math.

 **I am currently looking for internships for Summer 2024 so please reach out about any opportunities :)**

My research so far focuses on the following:
- Improving machine learning algorithms like PCA, subspace clustering, and manifold learning under heteroscedastic (noisy) data conditions
- Optimization algorithms and guarantees for Dynamic MRI

In the navigation bar above, I have various sections available ranging from:
 1. **Publications** = Publications and preprints
 2. **Talks** = Talks/Presentations over the years at various academic groups/conferences
 3. **Teaching/Awards** = Teaching experience and academic awards received over the years
 4. **Industry** = Industry experience and portfolio
 5. **Grad Work** = Graduate portfolio and projects
 6. **Undergrad Work** = Undergraduate portfolio and projects
 7. **Certs** = Certifications ranging from IT, 3D mechanical design, and more
 8. **CV** = A one page CV/Resume PDF
