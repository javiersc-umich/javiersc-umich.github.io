title: "ALPCAHUS: Sample-wise Heteroscedastic PCA and Subspace Clustering (Union of Subspaces)"

permalink: /publication/2023-09-10-alpcahus
excerpt: 'Principal component analysis (PCA) is a key tool in the field of data dimensionality reduction
that is useful for various data science problems.
However, many applications
involve heterogeneous data that varies in quality
due to noise characteristics associated with different sources of the data.
Methods that deal with this mixed dataset are known as heteroscedastic methods.
This paper develops a PCA method
that can estimate the sample-wise noise variances
and use this information in the model
to improve the estimate of the subspace basis associated with the low-rank structure of the data.
This method is extended to the Union of Subspace (UoS) setting also known as subspace clustering which is an unsupervised machine learning problem that generally entails grouping points that lie near a union of affine subspaces. Some applications involve heterogeneous data that varies in quality
due to noise characteristics associated with different sources of the data, and
methods that deal with this mixed dataset are known as heteroscedastic methods. We present an ALPCAH extension based on ensemble K-Subspaces (EKSS) that incorporates the ALPCAH objective function for heteroscedastic subspace basis estimation.
Simulations show the effectiveness of accounting for such heteroscedasticity in the data with comparisons against other subspace approximation and subspace clustering methods established in the literature.
